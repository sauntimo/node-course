# node-course

I'm enjoying learning some node from a Udemy course. You can see the example from the /node-web-sever/ folder up on http://sauntimo-node-course.herokuapp.com/

Fun fact; I discovered you can push subfolders from a repo to a remote which is useful.

`git subtree push --prefix node-web-server heroku master`
